description: "A Digital Garden: Capturing my daily thoughts and progress, as well as curated ideas with unique synthesisâ€”a personal zettelkasten."
footer_description:
  'The phrase "digital garden" is a metaphor for thinking about writing and creating that focuses less on the
  resulting "showpiece" and more on the process, care, and craft it takes to get there. While not everybody
  has or works in a dirt garden, we all share a familiarity with the idea of what a garden is.'
